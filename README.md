My React App Boilerplate
=====================

Quickstart project template for learning React.

### Objective

This boilerplate is purposefully simple to show the minimal setup needed to create React projects with Webpack and Babel. It aims to be a starting point for learning React, with low cognitive load and as such avoids having many separate config files and advanced configuration options, while providing a solid foundation for new React projects.

### Usage
**Clone this repository**
```
git clone git@github.com:pro-react/react-app-boilerplate.git
```

**Install**
```
npm install
```

**Start the application in development mode**
```
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Static files are served from the `public` folder, project JavaScript files are bundled from the `app` folder.

**When ready, build for production**
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a minimized bundle.js file on the `public` folder.
